/*
 * hello.c — the in-browser C compile-and-run demo (cv-mac #64).
 *
 * This source builds end-to-end in the playground itself: the
 * `Build & Run (in-browser)` button compiles it through cc1.wasm →
 * as.wasm → ld.wasm → Elf2Mac.wasm and hot-loads the resulting
 * MacBinary II APPL into BasiliskII. **No CI involved** — the
 * binary you boot is whatever the WebAssembly toolchain in your tab
 * just emitted. First time anyone can write classic Mac C in a
 * browser and watch it run.
 *
 * Why this app exists separately from `hello-mac/hello.c`:
 *   - `hello-mac/` is a full Toolbox example with a window, menus,
 *     a `.r` resource file, and the CMake recipe CI uses to produce
 *     the `.code.bin` that the splice flow fetches. It demonstrates
 *     "classic Mac app structure".
 *   - This `wasm-hello/` deliberately has *no resources* (no
 *     `.r` file, no `WIND`/`MENU`/`STR#`) so we can prove the
 *     in-browser pipeline end-to-end *without* the resource-fork
 *     splice step that other projects rely on. DrawString into the
 *     desktop port is visible without a window.
 *
 * If you've never seen 68k Mac Toolbox C, read
 * `hello-mac/hello.c` first — it explains Pascal strings, the
 * Toolbox init incantation, and the event loop. This one keeps
 * the surface area as small as the Toolbox allows.
 *
 * Source mirrors `wasm-retro-cc/spike/hello_toolbox.c` — the Phase 2.0
 * derisk binary. Building this in-browser and seeing it boot is the
 * milestone that closes the cv-mac #64 north star.
